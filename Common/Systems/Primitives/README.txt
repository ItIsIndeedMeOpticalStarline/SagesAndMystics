Ok, full transparency!

The code here is not very good, and an amalgam of two seperate codebases primitive systems with my own sadistic twists. Most of
the code was from the mod Starlight River and most of the rest was from the mod Terrafirma. It's called a ribbon instead of a 
trail because the name ribbon is prettier. (Girl power!) Feel free to use it if you want to, but please credit Starlight River
and Terrafirma if you do so, ideally by keeping this README here.
